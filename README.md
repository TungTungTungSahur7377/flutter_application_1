This is my first Flutter program. I did everything based on the instructions provided.

This page was created based on the tutorial “https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmYL-VK75-o.” It was edited so that the basic structure is the same, but functions were added, such as a shopping cart that allows me to purchase products, add more items, or remove items directly from the cart, and a more professional touch with a more minimalist color palette.
