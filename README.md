This is my first Flutter program. I did everything based on the instructions provided.

This page was created based on the tutorial “https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmYL-VK75-o.” It was edited so that the basic structure is the same, but functions were added, such as a shopping cart that allows me to purchase products, add more items, or remove items directly from the cart, and a more professional touch with a more minimalist color palette.

This program is ready to use. The steps to run it on your device are:
1. Download the .zip folder.
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Create a new project in Visual Studio Code, with the application format. This is done from the device “new project.”
4. Once the project has been created, copy all the files from the unzipped folder you just downloaded from here
5. Paste all those files into the folder where you created your new project. When the message asking you to replace existing files appears, click yes
6. That's it! Press F5 and select Chrome as the simulation environment. It should work without any problems.
